   - Crosstabs and conditional probabilities  
   - Product-wise demographic breakdowns  

3. **Customer Profiling**  
   - Segmented customers by AgeBand, IncomeBand, UsageBand, FitnessBand  
   - Multi-way crosstabs for deeper profiling  

4. **Business Insights**  
   - Product mix share  
   - Median usage, income, fitness per product
